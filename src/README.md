## Dependencies

- **postal-mime**: MIME parser for Cloudflare Email Worker inbound messages
- **agents**: Cloudflare Agents SDK for Durable Object-backed email routing, sending, state, and scheduling
- **ai** + **ai-gateway-provider**: Vercel AI SDK with Cloudflare AI Gateway provider
- **zod**: Schema validation for structured agent responses

## Cloudflare Bindings

- **R2_BUCKET**: R2 bucket for document storage (policies, prompts)
- **UserAgent**: Durable Object binding for per-user Agent state and scheduled memory updates
- **ASSETS**: Static assets binding for prompt templates
- **EMAIL**: Email Service binding used by `Agent.sendEmail()`; sender-restricted with no destination restriction

## Environment Variables (Secrets)

- **CF_AIG_AUTH**: Cloudflare AI Gateway authentication token

Inbound sender authorization is a code-reviewed policy in `src/config.ts`: `forces.gc.ca` plus the exact mailbox `luffy@luffy.email`. It has no deployment-variable override.

## Email Delivery Contract

Authorized inbound messages route directly to the `UserAgent` keyed by the normalized SMTP envelope sender; agent-routing headers are ignored. Successful responses use the official `Agent.sendEmail()` helper with the inbound monitored alias as `from`/`replyTo`, validated threading and subject headers, and a maximum of 50 combined recipients. The Agents SDK email observability hook is disabled while application logging remains basic.

Reply-all mirrors a normal email client: every valid, unique `Reply-To` mailbox is a primary `To` recipient, with RFC `From` used when no valid `Reply-To` mailbox remains. Original `To` then `Cc` addresses are retained in order as CC recipients after excluding `Bcc`, malformed or duplicate addresses, primary and sender identities, and CAF-GPT/self addresses. Valid external recipients are allowed.

Processing failures before `sendEmail()` begins attempt one generic plain-text, sender-only response through `Agent.replyToEmail()`. Once the normal send attempt begins, failures are logged and stop without a fallback reply. Top-level route/DO/RPC failures use generic `setReject()` and return. Duplicate inbound deliveries may produce duplicate work or replies; this is an accepted hobby-project tradeoff.
