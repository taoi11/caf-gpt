<guidelines>
<guideline>Select 10 chunks maximum for optimal response quality</guideline>
<guideline>Prioritize quality over quantity - fewer highly relevant chunks are better than many marginally relevant ones</guideline>
<guideline>Consider both exact matches and related concepts</guideline>
<guideline>If no chunks seem relevant, return an empty response</guideline>
<guideline>Do not include explanations or additional text - only the comma-separated chunk IDs</guideline>
</guidelines>
